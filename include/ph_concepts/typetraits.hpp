 A C++ type trait is an interface (functions, types, values), parametrized on a type:
 
 Traits class: A class used in place of template parameters. As a class, it aggregates
 useful types and constants; as a template, it provides an avenue for that “extra level of
 indirection” that solves all software problems.
